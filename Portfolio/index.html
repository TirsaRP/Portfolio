    <h2>About this project:</h2>
    <p>While working as a product developer<br>
        I needed to create a whole new <br>
        experience for our customers. <br>
        This was a new division of<br>
        the company. I started with knowing<br>
        the requirements of our company,<br>
        of the company we were franchising to,<br>
        and of parents who want to book parties<br>
        outside of the home. Then I conducted<br>
        a lot of research of what activities <br>
        are age appropriate: what are the<br>
        children in our target age group<br>
        capable of physically and cognitively.<br> 
        I then searched for which activities<br>
        met that criteria. I developed some <br>
        of my own activities and repurposed <br>
        others. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Once I knew which activities<br>
        I wanted to incorporate into <br>
        the program, I started developing<br>
        the artefacts. I created maps,<br>
        posters, masks, scavenger items,<br>
        and more. Each party had a different<br> 
        theme, so each item needed to <br>
        be specific to that theme and <br>
        character (mascot).
    </p>
    <p>
        When the first parties were booked,<br>
        I trained the employees that<br>
        would lead the parties.<br>
        Then I would observe each party,<br>
        interview the parents and the leaders<br> 
        afterwards to get feedback on what <br>
        they thought worked and what <br>
        needed to be changed. There <br>
        were many iterations before we <br>
        refined our product and found<br>
        a layout that worked for <br>
        everyone. <br>
