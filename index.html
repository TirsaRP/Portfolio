        <h1>TIRSA RAMOS-PEDERSEN</h1>
        <h2>About &nbsp; this &nbsp; project:</h2>
        <p>While working as a product developer for MyEsteeme, I was responsible for creating a whole new experience for
            our customers. This was a new division of the company. I began by addressing the needs of the stakeholders. Knowing
            the requirements of our company, of the company we were franchising to, and of our customers; parents who want
            to book parties outside of their home. I then conducted research on what activities were age appropriate: what
            the children in our target age group are capable of physically and cognitively.I then searched for activities
            that met the criteria. I developed a few of my own activities and repurposed others found online.

        </p>
        <p>
            Once I knew which activities I wanted to incorporate into the program, I started developing the artefacts. I created maps,
            posters, masks, scavenger items, and more. Each party had a different theme, so each item needed to be specific
            to the particular theme and character (mascot). For example, one party had a space theme. That party package
            included space related games and challenges that engaged the children's fine and gross motor skills. In addition
            to creating enjoyable activities, they needed to be educational, as well as follow the equal treatment values
            of MyEsteeme.
